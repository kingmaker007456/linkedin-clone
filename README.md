Project Overview
This is a frontend-only clone of the popular professional networking site, LinkedIn. The goal of this project is to replicate the visual design, layout, and core user interface components of the platform using standard web technologies.

This project utilizes a minimal stack, focusing on fundamental frontend development skills:

HTML5 for structure and semantic content.

CSS3 for styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and visual appeal.

Vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements and dynamic content manipulation.

Disclaimer: This is purely a visual and interactive simulation; it does not connect to any actual backend services, user databases, or API for fetching real LinkedIn data.

Features
The clone aims to implement the following key features and UI components:

Core Components
Header/Navigation Bar: Sticky top bar with a search field, quick navigation icons (Home, My Network, Jobs, Messaging, Notifications), and a user profile dropdown.

Main Content Layout: A three-column grid/flex layout typical of LinkedIn:

Left Sidebar: User profile snapshot (name, job title, connections) and quick links (Groups, Events).

Central Feed: The main scrolling feed displaying simulated posts.

Right Sidebar: "Add to your feed" suggestions and "LinkedIn News" section.

Post Creation Interface: A simple area at the top of the feed to simulate creating a new post (text/media input).

Interactive Elements (Simulated via JavaScript)
"Like/React" Buttons: Basic click handlers to simulate incrementing a like count on a post.

Simulated Post Loading: A basic feature using JavaScript to dynamically add new post elements to the feed.

Responsive Design: Optimized layout for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS Media Queries.

📂 File Structure
The project follows a standard, flat structure for a simple frontend application:

linkedin-clone/
├── index.html          # The main HTML structure of the application.
├── style.css           # The CSS file containing all styling rules.
└── script.js           # The JavaScript file for dynamic behavior and interactivity.
└── README.md           # This file.
💻 Getting Started
To view and run this project locally, follow these simple steps:
